Gene:6532562407	AT1G11310	AT1G11310.3	protein_coding	A member of a large family of seven-transmembrane domain proteins specific to plants, homologs of the barley mildew resistance locus o (MLO) protein. The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes. ATMLO2 belongs to the clade IV, with AtMLO3, AtMLO6 and AtMLO12. The gene is expressed during early seedling growth, in roots, in vascular system of cotyledons and young leaves,and in fruit abscission zone; it was not expressed in anthers and pollen, as shown by GUS activity patterns. The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene, jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin, glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter.

The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes.

Induced by salicylic acid. Independent of NPR1 for their induction by salicylic acid. UGT1 encodes a protein with glucosyltransferase activity with high sequence homology to UGT2 (AT1G05530). It belongs to an UGT subfamily that binds UDP-glucose but not UDP-glucuronate, UDP-galactose, or UDP-rhamnose as the glycosyl donor. UGT1 was shown to be able to use abscisic acid as glycosylation substrate in the presence of UDP-glucose. UGT1/UGT75B1 catalyzes the formation of the p-aminobenzoate-glucose ester in vitro and in vivo. It appears to be the enzyme predominantly responsible for pABA-Glc formation in Arabidopsis based on assays in leaves, flowers, and siliques.

The Arabidopsis genome contains 15 genes encoding MLO proteins, with localization in plasma membrane. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four clades of closely-related AtMLO genes.

The expression of several phylogenetically closely-related AtMLO genes showed similar or overlapping tissue specificity and analogous responsiveness to external stimuli, suggesting functional redundancy, co-function, or antagonistic function(s). mlo resistance in A. thaliana does not involve the signaling molecules ethylene, jasmonic acid or salicylic acid, but requires a syntaxin, glycosyl hydrolase and ABC transporter.
