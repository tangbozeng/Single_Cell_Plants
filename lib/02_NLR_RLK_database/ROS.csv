Gene:2011343	AT1G35720	AT1G35720.1	protein_coding	Encodes a member of the annexin gene family, a diverse, multigene family of calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins. The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion. It is a Ca  2+-permeable transporter providing a molecular link between reactive oxygen species and cytosolic Ca 2+ in plants. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Gene:2178266	AT5G23040	AT5G23040.1	protein_coding	Encodes a protein that enables protochlorophillide's binding to pPORA's transit sequence, regulating pPORA's translocation into the plastid stroma, and blocking movement of the translocating polypeptide chain back into the cytosol. Causes Bax mediated lethality in yeast by generating reactive oxygen species and this effect is suppressed by AtBI-1.

Gene:2065133	AT2G47270	AT2G47270.1	protein_coding	Encodes UPBEAT1 (UPB1), a transcription factor with a bHLH domain. Regulates the expression of a set of peroxidases that modulate the balance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) between the zones of cell proliferation and the zone of cell elongation where differentiation begins. Disruption of UPB1 activity alters this ROS balance, leading to a delay in the onset of differentiation. Regulates growth by  mediating cell cycle progression.
