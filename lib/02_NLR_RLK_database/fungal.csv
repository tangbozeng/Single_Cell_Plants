Gene:2134024	AT4G19810	AT4G19810.1	protein_coding	ChiC encodes a Class V chitinase that is a part of glycoside hydrolase family 18 based on CAZy groupings. It appears to primarily act as an exochitinase in vitro where it predominantly cleaves a chitobiose (GlcNAc)2 residue from the non-reducing end of a chitin oligosaccharide. However, it shows some minor endochitinase activity in vitro, as well. A putative 24 amino-acid signal peptide may direct this protein to the secretory system and it has been detected in cell wall apoplastic fluid. RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that ChiC transcript levels are increased in response to abscisisc acid, jasmonic acid, and NaCl stress.

It appears to primarily act as an exochitinase in vitro where it predominantly cleaves a chitobiose (GlcNAc)2 residue from the non-reducing end of a chitin oligosaccharide. However, it shows some minor endochitinase activity in vitro, as well. A putative 24 amino-acid signal peptide may direct this protein to the secretory system and it has been detected in cell wall apoplastic fluid. RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that ChiC transcript levels are increased in response to abscisisc acid, jasmonic acid, and NaCl stress.
