Gene:5019474476	AT5G10140	AT5G10140.3	protein_coding	MADS-box protein encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS C - transcription factor that functions as a repressor of floral transition and contributes to temperature compensation of the circadian clock. Expression is downregulated during cold treatment. Vernalization, FRI and the autonomous pathway all influence the state of FLC chromatin. Both maternal and paternal alleles are reset by vernalization, but their earliest activation differs in timing and location. Histone H3 trimethylation at lysine 4 and histone acetylation are associated with active FLC expression, whereas histone deacetylation and histone H3 dimethylation at lysines 9 and 27 are involved in FLC repression. Expression is also repressed by two small RNAs (30- and 24-nt) complementary to the FLC sense strand 3? to the polyA site. The small RNAs are most likely derived from an antisense transcript of FLC. Interacts with SOC1 and FT chromatin in vivo. Member of a protein complex.
