Gene:6532563938	AT2G17290	AT2G17290.2	protein_coding	Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 6 (CPK6), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  The protein kinase CPK6 is shown in biochemical assays to be directly activated by elevations in calcium concentrations in the physiological range (Laanements et al., 2013 PlantPhys.; PMID: 23766366). These data correlate with the in vivo function of CPK6 in Ca2+ and ABA activation of S-type anion channels (Mori et al., 2006 PLoS Biol.;  PMID: 17032064) and the ability of CPK6 to mediate ABA activation of SLAC1 (Brandt et al., 2012 PNAS; PMID: 22689970).The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.		 plasma membrane, L mature pollen stage, LP.02 two leaves visible stage, LP.04 four leaves visible stage, LP.06 six leaves visible stage, LP.08 eight leaves visible stage, LP.10 ten leaves visible stage, LP.12 twelve leaves visible stage, M germinated pollen stage, NOT cytosol, abscisic acid-activated signaling pathway, calcium ion binding, calcium-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity, calmodulin binding, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase activity, carpel, cauline leaf, cell-to-cell mobile RNA, collective leaf structure, cotyledon, cultured plant cell, cytoplasm, cytosol, flower, flower pedicel, flowering stage, guard cell, hypocotyl, inflorescence meristem, intracellular signal transduction, leaf apex, leaf lamina base, mature plant embryo stage, membrane, mesophyll cell, mitochondrion, nucleus, peptidyl-serine phosphorylation, petal, petal differentiation and expansion stage, petiole, plant embryo, plant embryo bilateral stage, plant embryo cotyledonary stage, plant embryo globular stage, plasma membrane, pollen, pollen tube cell, protein autophosphorylation, protein binding, protein phosphorylation, protein serine kinase activity, protein serine/threonine kinase activity, regulation of anion channel activity, regulation of stomatal movement, regulation of stomatal opening, response to abscisic acid, root, rosette leaf, seed, sepal, shoot apex, shoot system, stamen, stem, vascular leaf, vascular leaf senescent stage	true

Gene:2011343	AT1G35720	AT1G35720.1	protein_coding	Encodes a member of the annexin gene family, a diverse, multigene family of calcium-dependent, membrane-binding proteins. The protein was determined to have peroxidase activity. This activity is thought to be dependent on the presence of post-translational modifications (most likely phosphorylation). The protein was shown to be present as a mixture of monomer and homodimer. The homodimerization seems to be dependent on the presence of Ca2+ or H2O2. The dimerization was prevented by the addition of DTT, &#946;-mercaptoethanol and TCEP. Annat1 mRNA is expressed in flowers, roots,leaves and stems and is most abundant in stems. mRNA levels are increased in response to oxidative stress.  Developmental expression patterns suggest a role in Golgi-mediated polysaccharide secretion. It is a Ca  2+-permeable transporter providing a molecular link between reactive oxygen species and cytosolic Ca 2+ in plants. The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Gene:2827527	AT2G17290	AT2G17290.1	protein_coding	Encodes calcium dependent protein kinase 6 (CPK6), a member of the Arabidopsis CDPK gene family.  CDPKs contain an intrinsic Ca2+-activation domain with four EF hand Ca2+-binding sites.  CDPKs protein kinases have been proposed to function in multiple plant signal transduction pathways downstream of [Ca2+]cyt elevations, thus transducing various physiological responses.  CPK6 is expressed in both guard cells and mesophyll cells.  Functions in guard cell ion channel regulation.   ABA and Ca(2+) activation of slow-type anion channels and, interestingly, ABA activation of plasma membrane Ca(2+)-permeable channels were impaired in independent alleles of single and double cpk3cpk6 mutant guard cells.  Furthermore, ABA- and Ca(2+)-induced stomatal closing were partially impaired in these cpk3cpk6 mutant alleles.  The protein kinase CPK6 is shown in biochemical assays to be directly activated by elevations in calcium concentrations in the physiological range (Laanements et al., 2013 PlantPhys.; PMID: 23766366). These data correlate with the in vivo function of CPK6 in Ca2+ and ABA activation of S-type anion channels (Mori et al., 2006 PLoS Biol.;  PMID: 17032064) and the ability of CPK6 to mediate ABA activation of SLAC1 (Brandt et al., 2012 PNAS; PMID: 22689970). The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.

Mutants carrying null alleles express similar fruit phenotypes, as seen in er plants, but differ from er in that the stem is only slightly shorter than that in the wild type, the pedicel is slightly longer than that in the wild type, and the leaves are rounder than those in er mutants. Gene is expressed in all tissues examined, with highest expression level found in siliques. It is involved in resistance to Plectosphaerella cucumerina. The predicted protein has two DWD motifs. It can bind to DDB1a in Y2H assays and may be involved in the formation of a CUL4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase.  It seems to be involved in the calcium-mediated response to extracellular ATP.

Gene:2062267	AT2G34650	AT2G34650.1	protein_coding	Encodes a protein serine/threonine kinase that may act as a positive regulator of cellular auxin efflux, as a a binary switch for PIN polarity, and as a negative regulator of auxin signaling. Recessive mutants exhibit similar phenotypes as pin-formed mutants in flowers and inflorescence but distinct phenotypes in cotyledons and leaves. Expressed in the vascular tissue proximal to root and shoot meristems, shoot apex, and embryos. Expression is induced by auxin. Overexpression of the gene results in phenotypes in the root and shoot similar to those found in auxin-insensitive mutants. The protein physically interacts with TCH3 (TOUCH3) and PID-BINDING PROTEIN 1 (PBP1), a previously uncharacterized protein containing putative EF-hand calcium-binding motifs.  Acts together with ENP (ENHANCER OF PINOID) to instruct precursor cells to elaborate cotyledons in the transition stage embryo. Interacts with PDK1. PID autophosphorylation is required for the ability of PID to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate. PID activation loop is required for PDK1-dependent PID phosphorylation and requires the PIF domain. Negative regulator of root hair growth. PID kinase activity is critical for the inhibition of root hair growth and for maintaining  the proper subcellular localization of PID.

Arabidopsis separase contains a predicted 2Fe2S-ferredoxin domain that is not present in the proteins of other organisms. Also contains a putative EF-hand calcium binding domain. Mutant seeds exhibited embryo arrest at the globular stage. The endosperm also exhibited a weak titan-like phenotype. Transgenic plants expressing AESP RNA interference (RNAi) from the meiosis-specific DMC1 promoter exhibited alterations in chromosome segregation during meiosis I and II that resulted in polyads containing from one to eight microspores. Plays an essential role in embryo development.  Required for the removal of cohesin from meiotic chromosomes and establishment of meiotic nuclear domains. This gene was also identified through the rsw4 mutant. Lines carrying recessive, temperature-sensitive mutations exhibit reduced anisotropic growth at 30 degrees Celsius.

Gene:6532555763	AT4G20260	AT4G20260.8	protein_coding	Encodes a Ca2+ and Cu2+ binding protein. N-terminal myristylation on glycine 2 appears to enable it to associate tightly with the plasma membrane. Recombinant PCaP1 interacts strongly with phosphatidylinositol 3,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,5)P2) and  PtdIns (3,4,5)P3, and weakly with PtdIns(3,5)P2 and PtdIns(4,5). It also interacts with calmodulin (CaM) in a calcium-dependent manner. CaM does not interfere with PCaP1 membrane localization but does weaken interactions between it and the PtdInsPs. PCaP1 has an apparent Kd of 10 uM for Cu2+ and can bind six ions per protein. Transcript levels for PCaP1 first fall and then rise following exposure to CuCl2.
