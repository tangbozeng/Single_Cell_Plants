JAZ1 can interact with the COI1 F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase in a yeast-two-hybrid assay only in the presence of jasmonate-isoleucine (JA-ILE) or coronatine. Application of jasmonate methyl ester to Arabidopsis roots reduces the levels of a JAZ1:GUS fusion protein, presumably  by stimulating ubiquitin-proteasome-mediated degradation. The Jas domain appears to be important for JAZ1-COI1 interactions in the presence of coronatine. Two positive residues (R205 and R206) in the Jas domain shown to be important for coronatine -dependent COI1 binding are not required for binding AtMYC2. JAZ1 interacts with MYB21/MYB24,  the WD-repeat/bHLH/MYB complex and IIId bHLH factors (bHLH3, bHLH13, bHLH14 and bHLH17) to regulate jasmonate responses, including stamen development, trichome initiation, anthocyanin accumulation and plant defense.The mRNA is cell-to-cell mobile.		 nucleus, LP.02 two leaves visible stage, LP.04 four leaves visible stage, LP.06 six leaves visible stage, LP.08 eight leaves visible stage, LP.10 ten leaves visible stage, LP.12 twelve leaves visible stage, carpel, cauline leaf, cell-to-cell mobile RNA, collective leaf structure, cotyledon, defense response to bacterium, flower, flower development, flower pedicel, flowering stage, guard cell, hypocotyl, identical protein binding, inflorescence meristem, jasmonic acid mediated signaling pathway, leaf apex, leaf lamina base, mature plant embryo stage, nucleus, petal, petal differentiation and expansion stage, petiole, plant embryo, plant embryo bilateral stage, plant embryo cotyledonary stage, plant embryo globular stage, pollen, pollen development, pollen tube cell, protein binding, regulation of cellular response to alkaline pH, regulation of defense response, regulation of jasmonic acid mediated signaling pathway, response to jasmonic acid, response to wounding, root, seed, sepal, shoot apex, shoot system, stamen, stem, vascular leaf, vascular leaf senescent stage	true
