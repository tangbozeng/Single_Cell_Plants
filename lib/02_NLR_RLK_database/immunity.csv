Gene:2039637	AT2G27250	AT2G27250.1	protein_coding	One of the three CLAVATA genes controlling the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis.  Belongs to a large gene family called CLE for CLAVATA3/ESR-related.  Encodes a stem cell-specific protein CLV3 presumed to be a precursor of a secreted peptide hormone.  The deduced ORF encodes a 96-amino acid protein with an 18-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide.  The functional form of CLV3 (MCLV3) was first reported to be a posttranscriptionally modified 12-amino acid peptide, in which two of the three prolines were modified to hydroxyproline (Ito et al., Science 2006, 313:842; Kondo et al., Science 2006, 313:845).  Ohyama et al. (2009) later reported that the active mature CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide (Nature Chemical Biology, 5:578).  CLV3 binds the ectodomain of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor-kinase. Regulates shoot and floral meristem development. Required for CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and a Rho-related protein.  It restricts its own domain of expression, the central zone (CZ) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells, which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate. CLE domain of CLV3 is sufficient for function. Results obtained from whole seedlings challenge the concept that the immune receptor FLS2 perceives the meristematic regulatory peptide CLV3p in mesophyll, seedlings, and SAM cells and that CLV3p contributes to SAM immunity against bacterial infection (PMID:22923673).

Gene:4515101172	AT2G27250	AT2G27250.3	protein_coding	One of the three CLAVATA genes controlling the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis.  Belongs to a large gene family called CLE for CLAVATA3/ESR-related.  Encodes a stem cell-specific protein CLV3 presumed to be a precursor of a secreted peptide hormone.  The deduced ORF encodes a 96-amino acid protein with an 18-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide.  The functional form of CLV3 (MCLV3) was first reported to be a posttranscriptionally modified 12-amino acid peptide, in which two of the three prolines were modified to hydroxyproline (Ito et al., Science 2006, 313:842; Kondo et al., Science 2006, 313:845).  Ohyama et al. (2009) later reported that the active mature CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide (Nature Chemical Biology, 5:578).  CLV3 binds the ectodomain of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor-kinase. Regulates shoot and floral meristem development. Required for CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and a Rho-related protein.  It restricts its own domain of expression, the central zone (CZ) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells, which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate. CLE domain of CLV3 is sufficient for function. Results obtained from whole seedlings challenge the concept that the immune receptor FLS2 perceives the meristematic regulatory peptide CLV3p in mesophyll, seedlings, and SAM cells and that CLV3p contributes to SAM immunity against bacterial infection (PMID:22923673).

Gene:1006228012	AT2G27250	AT2G27250.2	protein_coding	One of the three CLAVATA genes controlling the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis.  Belongs to a large gene family called CLE for CLAVATA3/ESR-related.  Encodes a stem cell-specific protein CLV3 presumed to be a precursor of a secreted peptide hormone.  The deduced ORF encodes a 96-amino acid protein with an 18-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide.  The functional form of CLV3 (MCLV3) was first reported to be a posttranscriptionally modified 12-amino acid peptide, in which two of the three prolines were modified to hydroxyproline (Ito et al., Science 2006, 313:842; Kondo et al., Science 2006, 313:845).  Ohyama et al. (2009) later reported that the active mature CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide (Nature Chemical Biology, 5:578).  CLV3 binds the ectodomain of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor-kinase. Regulates shoot and floral meristem development. Required for CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and a Rho-related protein.  It restricts its own domain of expression, the central zone (CZ) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells, which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate. CLE domain of CLV3 is sufficient for function. Results obtained from whole seedlings challenge the concept that the immune receptor FLS2 perceives the meristematic regulatory peptide CLV3p in mesophyll, seedlings, and SAM cells and that CLV3p contributes to SAM immunity against bacterial infection (PMID:22923673).
