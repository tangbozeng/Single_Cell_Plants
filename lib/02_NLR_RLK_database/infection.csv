Gene:2039637	AT2G27250	AT2G27250.1	protein_coding	One of the three CLAVATA genes controlling the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis.  Belongs to a large gene family called CLE for CLAVATA3/ESR-related.  Encodes a stem cell-specific protein CLV3 presumed to be a precursor of a secreted peptide hormone.  The deduced ORF encodes a 96-amino acid protein with an 18-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide.  The functional form of CLV3 (MCLV3) was first reported to be a posttranscriptionally modified 12-amino acid peptide, in which two of the three prolines were modified to hydroxyproline (Ito et al., Science 2006, 313:842; Kondo et al., Science 2006, 313:845).  Ohyama et al. (2009) later reported that the active mature CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide (Nature Chemical Biology, 5:578).  CLV3 binds the ectodomain of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor-kinase. Regulates shoot and floral meristem development. Required for CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and a Rho-related protein.  It restricts its own domain of expression, the central zone (CZ) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells, which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate. CLE domain of CLV3 is sufficient for function. Results obtained from whole seedlings challenge the concept that the immune receptor FLS2 perceives the meristematic regulatory peptide CLV3p in mesophyll, seedlings, and SAM cells and that CLV3p contributes to SAM immunity against bacterial infection (PMID:22923673).

Gene:3699258	AT3G60190	AT3G60190.1	protein_coding	At3g60190 encodes Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein 1E, DRP1E, also known as EDR3, ADL4 and ADL1E, which is 624 amino acid residues long, has a predicted mass of 69.8 kDa and a pI of 7.5.  Dynamin-related protein 1E belongs to a plant-specific subclass of dynamin-related proteins (DRP1), consisting of five members in Arabidopsis (A, B, C, D, E). This class is characterized by having an N-terminal GTPase domain, a central ‘dynamin 2‘ domain and a C-terminal GTPase effector domain (GED), a typical structure for plant dynamin-related proteins. However, this class lacks a PH domain and a proline-rich domain, which are found in classical animal dynamin-like proteins. Based on work on animal dynamins, the plant DRP1 proteins should be able to form polymeric structures that wrap around membranes to facilitate membrane tubulation and pinching off of vesicles, processes that are essential to vesicle trafficking and membrane compartmentalization.  The edr3 mutation causes a P77L substitution in the G2 motif of the GTPase domain of DRP1E.  edr3 mutant Arabidopsis plants display enhanced cell death in response to powdery mildew infection.

Gene:1006228012	AT2G27250	AT2G27250.2	protein_coding	One of the three CLAVATA genes controlling the size of the shoot apical meristem (SAM) in Arabidopsis.  Belongs to a large gene family called CLE for CLAVATA3/ESR-related.  Encodes a stem cell-specific protein CLV3 presumed to be a precursor of a secreted peptide hormone.  The deduced ORF encodes a 96-amino acid protein with an 18-amino acid N-terminal signal peptide.  The functional form of CLV3 (MCLV3) was first reported to be a posttranscriptionally modified 12-amino acid peptide, in which two of the three prolines were modified to hydroxyproline (Ito et al., Science 2006, 313:842; Kondo et al., Science 2006, 313:845).  Ohyama et al. (2009) later reported that the active mature CLV3 is a 13-amino-acid arabinosylated glycopeptide (Nature Chemical Biology, 5:578).  CLV3 binds the ectodomain of the CLAVATA1 (CLV1) receptor-kinase. Regulates shoot and floral meristem development. Required for CLAVATA1 receptor-like kinase assembly into a signaling complex that includes KAPP and a Rho-related protein.  It restricts its own domain of expression, the central zone (CZ) of the shoot apical meristem (SAM), by preventing differentiation of peripheral zone cells, which surround the CZ, into CZ cells and restricts overall SAM size by a separate, long-range effect on cell division rate. CLE domain of CLV3 is sufficient for function. Results obtained from whole seedlings challenge the concept that the immune receptor FLS2 perceives the meristematic regulatory peptide CLV3p in mesophyll, seedlings, and SAM cells and that CLV3p contributes to SAM immunity against bacterial infection (PMID:22923673).
