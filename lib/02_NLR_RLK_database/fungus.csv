Gene:1006228506	AT3G11820	AT3G11820.2	protein_coding	Encodes a syntaxin localized at the plasma membrane. SYR1/PEN1 is a member of the SNARE superfamily and functions in positioning anchoring of the KAT1 K+ channel protein at the plasma membrane. Transcription is upregulated by abscisic acid, suggesting a role in ABA signaling.  Also functions in non-host resistance against barley powdery mildew. It is a nonessential component of the preinvasive resistance against Colletotrichum fungus. Required for mlo resistance. The syp121 point mutation results in stomatal phenotypes that reduce CO2 assimilation, slow vegetative growth and increase water use efficiency in the whole plant, conditional upon high light intensities and low relative humidity. The R20R21 motif of SYP121 are essential for SEC11 interaction. Mutation of the R20R21 motif blocks vesicle traffic without uncoupling the effects of SYP121 on solute and K+ uptake associated with the F9xRF motif; the mutation also mimicks the effects on traffic block observed on coexpression of the dominant negative SEC11?149 fragment.

Gene:2057731	AT2G26330	AT2G26330.1	protein_coding	Homologous to receptor protein kinases. Involved in specification of organs originating from the shoot apical meristem. Contains a cytoplasmic protein kinase catalytic domain, a transmembrane region, and an extracellular leucine-rich repeat.  ER has been identified as a quantitative trait locus for transpiration efficiency by influencing epidermal and mesophyll development, stomatal density and porosity of leaves. It has been implicated in resistance to the bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum and to the necrotrophic fungus Plectosphaerella cucumerina.  Together with ERL1 and ERL2, ER governs the initial decision of protodermal cells to either divide proliferatively to produce pavement cells or divide asymmetrically to generate stomatal complexes. ER binds to the peptides STOMAGEN and EPF2 which compete for the same binding site. The ER-EFP2 complex activates MAPK signaling that inhibits stomatal development. ER-STOMAGEN does not activate MAPK signaling. Plants harboring loss of function alleles of er are more susceptible to heat stress than wild type.  In Arabidopsis and other organisms, overexpression of ER confers thermotolerance via as yet undefined mechanisms.
